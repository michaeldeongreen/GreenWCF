	StructureMapServiceHost
	StructureMapServiceBehavior
	StructureMapInstanceProvider

Misc Classes:	
	IoC.cs - Creates the IoC Container
	StructureMapWcf.cs - Static class that has a StructureMapDependencyScope
	StructureMapDependencyScope.cs - In its constructor, accepts a IContainer
	
Workflow:
	StructureMapServiceHostFactory.cs
		IoC.cs
		StructureMapWcf.StructureMapDependencyScope.cs
		StructureMapServiceHost.cs
			StructureMapServiceBehavior.cs
				StructureMapInstanceProvider.cs
