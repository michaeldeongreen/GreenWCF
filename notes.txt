Nested Containers in WCF
https://gist.github.com/Cybermaxs/17d620d44a810c5bccce232178745048

These for classes handles the wiring up of WCF/StructureMap:
	StructureMapServiceHostFactory
	StructureMapServiceHost
	StructureMapServiceBehavior
	StructureMapInstanceProvider

Misc Classes:	
	IoC.cs - Creates the IoC Container
	StructureMapWcf.cs - Static class that has a StructureMapDependencyScope
	StructureMapDependencyScope.cs - In its constructor, accepts a IContainer
	
Workflow:
	StructureMapServiceHostFactory.cs
		IoC.cs
		StructureMapWcf.StructureMapDependencyScope.cs
		StructureMapServiceHost.cs
			StructureMapServiceBehavior.cs
				StructureMapInstanceProvider.cs
				
StructureMapInspector:
	Used to simulate Begin/End Request so we can create a nested container per request and dispose of it after each request.
